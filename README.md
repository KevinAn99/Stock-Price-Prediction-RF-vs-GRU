# Stock-Price-Prediction-RF-vs-GRU
This project compares Random Forest (RF) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for stock price prediction using Amazon (AMZN) stock data from 2015 to 2023. The analysis evaluates how machine learning (RF) and deep learning (GRU) models handle stock market forecasting, focusing on accuracy, variance, and feature importance.

# üìä Stock Price Prediction: Random Forest vs. GRU  

## üîç Project Overview  
This project compares the performance of **Random Forest (RF)** and **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** models for **predicting stock prices**. The goal is to analyze how **machine learning (RF)** and **deep learning (GRU)** handle stock market forecasting, considering accuracy, variance, and feature importance.  

## üìÅ Repository Contents  
- **`Stock-Price-Prediction-RF-vs-GRU.ipynb`** - Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
- **`amazon_stock_data_cleaned.csv`** - Preprocessed stock price dataset for model training.  
- **`Stock-Price-Prediction-RF-vs-GRU.pptx`** - Presentation summarizing findings and model comparison.  

## üìä Dataset Information  
- **Source:** Yahoo Finance - **Amazon (AMZN) stock data**  
- **Date Range:** 2015 - 2023  
- **Key Columns:**
  - **Features**: Open, High, Low, Volume  
  - **Target Variable**: Adjusted Close Price  
- **Dataset Size**: ~2000+ rows  

## üîß Methodology  
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing**
- Convert **Date** column to date format and remove invalid rows.  
- Ensure numerical columns (**Open, High, Low, Volume**) have no missing values.  
- Normalize features for **GRU training**.  
- Feature engineering:  
  - **RF Model:** Uses **Open, High, Low** as features.  
  - **GRU Model:** Includes **Moving Averages (MA10, MA50) and Volume Change**.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Model - Random Forest (RF)**
- **Features Used**: Open, High, Low  
- **Target Variable**: Adjusted Close Price  
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Number of Trees: **100** (adjustable via Streamlit UI)  
  - Train-Test Split: **80% training, 20% testing**  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Deep Learning Model - Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**
- **Model Architecture**:
  - **Input:** Last **5 days** of data (time window = 5).  
  - **Layers:** Two **GRU layers** (50 units each), Dropout (40%), Dense output layer.  
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Training Epochs: **50**  
  - Batch Size: **32**  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Comparison**
| Model  | Accuracy (R¬≤ Score) | Error (MSE) | Strengths |
|--------|------------------|------------|-----------|
| **Random Forest** | **High (close to 1.0)** | Low | Captures static relationships well |
| **GRU** | Lower than RF | Higher | Struggles with small datasets |

- **RF performed significantly better than GRU** on this dataset.  
- The **small dataset size** limited GRU's ability to fully utilize temporal dependencies.  
- Future work should explore **larger datasets** and **more complex deep learning architectures**.  

## üöÄ How to Run the Project  
1. **Install required dependencies**:  
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib seaborn yfinance
2. Download the dataset (amazon_stock_data_cleaned.csv) and place it in the same directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (Stock-Price-Prediction-RF-vs-GRU.ipynb) to train and evaluate models.
4. Analyze model performance using visualizations and metrics.
